Hi, I'm Dakshesh! I'm a PhD researcher at the UCL [Data Intensive Science CDT](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-intensive-science-industry/) using graph-based machine learning methods to study how galaxy properties are influenced by their large-scale structure environments. My research combined deep learning, statistics, and astrophysics for a comprehensive understanding of galaxy evolution.
